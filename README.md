# SteeringBehaviourAssignment
This project is part pf my Games Engines 2 module assignment. For this assignment, we had to simulate a scene of a space battle or dog fight from a movie of our choice. I decided to go with a world war 2 dog fight, inspired by Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk.

There is a PDF of the story board in this repo.
